This is a Computer Vision based project where I was provided with a dataset containig images of digits (i.e. 0-9) and I had to classify the images of test set as one of the digits (0-9). I used an ANN model at first and then tried CNN model (both with and without data augmentation). CNN model yielded high accuracy which was in complete contrast to the ANN one.
